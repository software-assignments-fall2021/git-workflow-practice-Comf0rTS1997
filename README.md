1. [Interesting Website about software development](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge)
2. Why I found it interesting? Because when I was working on a project with friends, we prefer to only implement our own parts instead of working on the same part at the same time. Well, we have tried to work on the same part at the same time, but I found it hard to harmonize my own logic of the program and my friends' ideas. But as the article said, the tight relationship between Jeff and Sanjay actually made the whole process more efficient.
